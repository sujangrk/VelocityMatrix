# VelocityMatrix
Velocity Matrix’s repositories host the codebase for the DataCanvas platform—a cutting-edge visual programming environment that empowers non-technical users to build complex data workflows without writing code. The repositories follow a structured branching model to support collaborative development, ensure code quality, and streamline deployment.

Each repository contains modular components of the platform, including backend services, frontend interfaces, and integration tools. Clear commit message conventions, pull request protocols, and conflict resolution guidelines are in place to maintain consistency and foster efficient teamwork among developers.

This approach enables Velocity Matrix to rapidly innovate while maintaining high standards for code reliability and maintainability.
